title: Finding MLE of Distribution's Parameters 
---

## Intro

Let's say, we count cars taking a right-hand turn at a road intersection during single sequences of the traffic lights controlling the intersection:

| No. of Cars|
| --- |
|4 9 0 5 8 10 6 8 5|

We know, that what we are looking for is a Random Variable (RV) which is distributed according to the Poisson Distribution with parameter \\(\lambda\\): $$ X \sim \mathcal{Poiss}(\lambda) $$



## Outro

OK
